Why did you pick this API topic?

The reason why I chose this API topic is because I am a big fan of cars and I think that to have a an API topic based on one of the fasted productions cars in the world would be a little interesting. 

Describe your API and the available data endpoints

My data endpoints available are /api/car and /api/history an what /api/car does is that it shows you the details and name of one of the worlds fastest productions cars in the world made by Bugatti, and /api/history shows details about Bugatti itself such as the name of the founder and where it was founded

How was your experience building your own API server after using other APIs as a client in Unit 2?

To be completely honest, building a small one like this was pretty easy and I would think that it takes a whole bunch more work to even get it working, but after seeing how simple it might be my experience was pretty good.
